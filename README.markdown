# Tricks of the Trade

## Summary

This repo holds the code for my personal website. This is not meant to be a plug-and-play blogging platform. It is intended to be an example to the community of a decently-sized Elm project. While learning Elm I found it difficult to find good examples. So far this project includes examples of the following:

* Animation
* Commands
* Composition
* Generics
* HTTP
* JSON
* Navigation
* Subscriptions
* And more
